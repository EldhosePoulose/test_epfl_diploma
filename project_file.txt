My name Eldhose Poulose. In July 2020 I finished my Master's degree in Applied Computational Life Sciences at ZHAW, Switzerland. Currently I am enrolled for my second master's programme in AI and Data Science at Technische Hochschule in Deggendorf, Germany. As part of the study I am doing my Internship at Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Liechtenstein as a Data Analyst.
